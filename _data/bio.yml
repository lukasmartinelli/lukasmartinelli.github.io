about: >
  I'm Lukas Martinelli, CEO of Reprompt (YC W24), where we're mapping the physical world with AI. 
  Previously, I spent 7 years running engineering, product, and operations for the Search business at Mapbox.
  I'm passionate about maps, open source software, and building tools that help developers work with geospatial data. 
  I have a history of creating widely adopted developer tools - my open source projects (15k+ stars) in the mapping industry are now used by companies like Amazon, IBM, and Bosch.
