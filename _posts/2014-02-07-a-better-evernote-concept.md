I recently try to move away from US services that contain too much of my life's private information. Evernote has been the #1 reason that I finally managed to get organized: I dump everything into the green elephant's brain to access it later. I've become so dependant on it, that the thought someone could read or parse my evernote notes, makes me shudder

Sadly there are no viable opensource alternatives out there, that were as complete and easy to use as Evernote. That's why I want to create an open source solution for the problems Evernote and its competitors solve.

## Problems Evernote solves
Evernote is a huge toolset that can solve many problems,  I listed the three most used workflows Evernote users have.

### Organizing Paperwork
A common task I find myself solving with Evernote is digitalizing and organizing paper work like invoices, business cards, letters, appointments etc.
People who have been organized before the digital age, have put these papers into folders (the real ones) and labelled them properly. With the computer the next approach was to scan the papers and with the Smartphone I can simply take a photo and it is stored and cannot be forgotten.
Evernote improves this workflow even more by cropping the picture and adjusting the contrast and brightness, so that it looks like a decent scan. You label the note and tag it appropriatly and voil√†: you got organized.

If we take a step back we notice, that this isn't actually note taking, this is about organizing and labelling resources. We are actually adding metadata like a Date, Place, Name and Tags to a digital file.

### Archiving the Web
Evernote keeps everything i've read and liked on the web and makes it searchable.
If I mark something on feedly it goes to Evernote, if I've read an interesting article on Pocket it goes to Evernote, if I've discovered an awesome website or article it goes to Evernote as well.

We're collecting and referencing external resources and add metadata to it, so it is archived and we can go back to it to enhance the information even more.

### Actual Note Taking and alot of Edge Cases
The more you add, the more useful Evernote becomes. I add everything that comes to my mind and might be useful for later to Evernote. Wether I am working on a project and have to take notes or studying and writing a quick outline of a lecture: I am creating actual content and enhance it with metadata.

## A more generic Approach to Notetaking
What Evernote provides and what we actually need, is a system that holds together all that loose information and enhances it with metadata.
A note contains metadata and references actual written content and resources like files or websites. It actually would be better to not store the content in Evernote, but only to use it to hold all the strings together.

## What is a Note?
A note is basically a metadata container with richt text and alot of external references.
