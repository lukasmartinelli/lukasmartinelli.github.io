There are many cloud storages that give you an initial free capacity to store data. After that, if you want more space you have to pay for it. It  is convenient to store all your data at the same cloud storage for the ease of access. But then your hitting the free space limit pretty quickly and you start paying.

## Existing cloud aggregators

There are some great cloud aggregators out there (like [Otixo](https://www.otixo.com/ "Otixo Cloud Aggregator") or [Jolidrive](http://www.jolicloud.com/ "Jolidrive Cloud Aggregator") that solve this problem by providing a common interface for all the different cloud storages and provide tools to interact between them. This is actually a great solution but has a few disadvantages:
- You have to trust the cloud aggregator
- Your data is unencrypted
- You have to move around the data to fully use your free limits
- You have to pay for them

I did a quick web research and found nothing that is both free of charge and secure.

## Usage Examples
Let's say you want to store all your backups in the cloud, because you want to follow 
the ["The Computer Backup Rule of Three"](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheComputerBackupRuleOfThree.aspx). You will hit the limit pretty soon and you have to start moving your files around different providers, create a new account for one provider an put your archive there and alot of other tricks. You also have to care about encryption and redundancy (Store backups at two different cloud storages) yourself. 

## Solution



Now I'm amazed that there is no solution out there, but perhaps there is and I haven't found it.
