## Idea in a nutshell

There are many cloud storages that provide a free capacity to store data. If you want more, you have to pay more. Now it is convenient to store all your data at the same cloud storage for the ease of access and the space is usually sufficient.
But when it comes to backups, you can never have enough storage and even your local harddrives run out of space. Have you ever considered storing it in the cloud? You probably don't have the space for it you say. Now what if you would assemble all of the different cloud services into one big disk, where you can store your backups encrypted and even redundant. That could be easily possible.
