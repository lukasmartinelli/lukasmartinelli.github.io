## Introduction
If you're a developer who wants to create his personal blog or portfolio, you probably first think of a wordpress site. But wait a moment, why should you place a bloated cms system behind something that is not managed by a non-developer, but of a person how knows how to create webpages. You only loose power of creating the content you want and a lot of time to create and customize a theme. This is why static site generators got popular recently.

### About site generators
Mick Gardner wrote a nice [introduction](http://www.mickgardner.com/2012/12/an-introduction-to-static-site.html) about static site generators and their pros and cons. But to summarize quickly, static site generators just create a bunch of html pages like you would create them manually, but adds nice features like templating.
I personally think it is important for a static site generator that it is well
documented, has a low learning curve and you don't have fight against it, because remember, thats why we chose to avoid a cms.
Because at the end you have only html pages, you can host them everywhere, you don't need a php environment.

### Jekyll and Github Pages
You could for example [host](https://developers.google.com/drive/publish-site) it for free]] on your Google Drive. Now I've chosen [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as a site generator and [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles) as the place to host, because what is better to host your content on a place, where all your dev work resides anyway. Plus you get all the awesome features Github has to offer.
Now in this tutorial i want to show you the quickest way to get started with your personall jekyll website on Github pages.

## Create Repository on GitHub
