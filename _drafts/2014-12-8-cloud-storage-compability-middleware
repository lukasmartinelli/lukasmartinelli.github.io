If you want to access files on Dropbox or Google Drive you need to use their APIs. But even though they all do exactly the same thing, their APIs all differ. I want to solve this problem by providing a **common API to end user cloud storages** that is **opensource and free**.

This is a follow up to my earlier post on [the future of Cuckoo Drive](http://lukasmartinelli.ch/idea/2014/07/03/future-of-cuckoodrive.html).

## Existing solutions

There are already commercial solutions for this problem:

- [Storage Made Easy](http://storagemadeeasy.com/personal_solution/)
- [Cloud Elements Documents Hub](http://www.cloud-elements.com/hubs/documents-hub/)
- [Kloudless](https://developers.kloudless.com/)

There are also solutions that are either platform specific (like SharpBox) or targeted towards commercial cloud storages (Apache projects):

- [SharpBox](http://sharpbox.codeplex.com/)
- [Apache Libcloud](http://libcloud.apache.org/)
- [Apache jClouds](https://jclouds.apache.org/)
