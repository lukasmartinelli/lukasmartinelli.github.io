## Evernote Use Case 1: Remembering an invoice

I recently try to move away from services that incorporate to much of my life's information. That's why i try to find workflows for my daily problems, where i previously used web apps or other services and try to use selfhosted opensource solutions, at least for stuff where privacy is important.

Evernote has been the #1 reason i finally managed to get organized. I dump everything into the elephant's brain to access it later.

I've become so dependant on it, that the thought someone could read or parse my evernote notes makes me shuddering.

In order to find a viable alternative, i first had to figure out what i use evernote for.

## Organizing Paperwork
A common task I find myself solving with Evernote is digitalizing and organizing paper work like invoices, business cards, letters, appointments etc.
People who have been organized before the digital age came to the rescue, have put these papers into folders (the real ones) and labelled them properly.
With the computer the next approach was to scan the paper, put it into folders (the virtual ones) and label them properly. 
With the smartphone and its great camera new possibilities evolved. I can simply take a photo and it is stored on my phone and cannot be forgotten.
With Evernote it is even better, as the page camera automates the task of adjusting the contrast and brightness and even crops it in the right format. You then label the note and tag it appropriatly and voil√† you got organized.

If we take a step back we notice, that this isn't actually note taking, this is organizing things. Evernote just solves the job because it has a huge toolset, but we're actually using the wrong tool for the job here.

If i would organize everything on my hard disk and i would have a decent search for that stuff my problem would be solved.

## Archiving the Web
Evernote keeps everything i've read and liked on the web and makes it searchable.
If I mark something on feedly it goes to Evernote, if I've read an interesting article on Pocket it goes to Evernote, if I've discovered an awesome website or article it goes to Evernote as well or if I'm researching something I put the links in Evernote as well.

I previously used a variety of tools for this, like Browser Bookmarks or Delicios.io
