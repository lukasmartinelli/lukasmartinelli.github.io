[Cuckoo Drive](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/cuckoodrive) is an [idea for an aggregated file system of public cloud storages](http://lukasmartinelli.ch/idea/2014/03/11/using-the-cloud-storages-as-one-big-encrypted-disk.html) that I am developing in Python with the help of [pyfilesystem](https://code.google.com/p/pyfilesystem/). I wrote several blog posts about it and I am interested in cloud storage and methods to make them more secure and avoid vendor lock-in.
