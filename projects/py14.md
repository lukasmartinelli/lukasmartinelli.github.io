This is a little experiment that shows how far you can go with the C++ 14 `auto` return type and templates. C++14 has such powerful type deduction that it is possible to transpile Python into C++ without worrying about the missing type annotations in python. Only a small subset of Python is working and you will encounter many bugs. The goal is to showcase the power of C++14 templates and not to create a fully functional transpiler.
