The [OSM2VectorTiles](http://osm2vectortiles.org) project is my study project and bachelor thesis.
It makes is possible to create vector tiles from OpenStreetMap data.
Create a custom base map in minutes with our free vector tiles from OpenStreetMap data.
This is the easiest way how to switch to OSM thanks to MapBox open-source tools. Design your own map of world or country, serve raster or vector tiles from any virtual server or your own infrastructure, even offline behind a firewall.
