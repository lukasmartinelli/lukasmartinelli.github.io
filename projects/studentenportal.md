The [studentenportal](https://studentenportal.ch/) is a place for students of [HSR](http://www.hsr.ch/) to share their documents and old exams. The web application is built with Django and we have about a thousand active users. I've taken over this project from [Danilo Bargen](https://dbrgn.ch/) in the last year and am actively developing new features.
