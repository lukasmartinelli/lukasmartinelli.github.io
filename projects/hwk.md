**hwk** tries to demonstrate how a modern Haskell based stream manipulation tool could look like. It is similar to tools like **awk** or **sed**. `hwk` allows compact command sequences that operate on a list of strings. Because Haskell is lazy and has a powerful arsenal of functions, there is no need to invent another DSL and hopefully push people into using functional goodness. `hwk` also provides a method to store small functions for reuse in environment variables.
