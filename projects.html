    I love contributing to Open Source projects and I love the
    collaboration and community around it.
    Take a look at my <a href="http://github.com/lukasmartinelli/">Github Page</a>. If you want to stalk me even further you
    can take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/graveyard">dead projects</a> as well.
