        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm <a href="/cv.html">Lukas Martinelli</a>, a software engineer from Switzerland.
        I am currently freelancing - shoot me an email for GIS contract work.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am very passionate about programming, cloud, the web, maps and especially open source.
        I love trying out new technologies and programming languages and
        have acquired a large and broad skill set across the entire software stack.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>

        <h3>Cloud and Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>I am able to take full usage of the cloud and have worked with both <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> and
        <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a>
        to create scalable solutions.
        I apply the <a href="http://12factor.net/">twelve-factor app</a> methodology in my projects and use <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a>
        and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> to manage my infrastructure.
        I work a lot with <a href="https://coreos.com/">CoreOS</a> and its
        surrounding technologies (<a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a>, <a href="https://github.com/coreos/fleet">fleet</a>, <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a>).
        I have built up a private PaaS with <a href="http://deis.io/get-deis/">Deis</a> that I managed with <a href="https://influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>
        and <a href="http://grafana.org/">Grafana</a> and learned a lot of lessons the hard way.
        </p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>
        Python is my current language of choice to get real work done quickly and glue things together, it is an indispensable tool in my belt.
        I have a very good understanding of the language and know the community, libraries and tools around it well.
        I have built multiple web applications using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and know the limits of Python due to maintainability.
        </p>

        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
        Even though I am more engineer than designer, I am able to create good looking websites with proper HTML and CSS.
        I put a lot of emphasis on <a href="https://smacss.com/">proper separation of concerns</a> and HTML5 semantics.
        I have an very good knowledge of CSS and use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> together with <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> to create responsive websites in a mobile-first approach.
        </p>

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
        I have a deep knowledge of JavaScript and its quirks. I've used it in many client projects to provide
        additional functionality and to create Single Page Applications (using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> or <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>).
        I am familiar with the current JavaScript frameworks and ecosystem (<a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>,
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a>,<a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a>).
        </p>

        <h3>.NET Platform</h3>
        <p>
        I have a very good understanding of C# and the .NET platform, as I have used C# and the .NET platform
        intensively in the four years of my apprenticeship. I've built ASP.NET MVC web applications (mainly custom eShops)
        in a team and have good expertise with LINQ, Entity Framework, WCF Web Services and IIS.
        </p>

        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>
        Java is the lingua franca of programming and I have worked with it a lot
        in the courses and assignments of my Bachelor's Degree.
        I have experience using <a href="">Gradle</a>, <a href="">Maven</a> and <a href="">sbt</a> and working
        with the <a href="https://www.playframework.com/">PlayFramework</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/javaserverfaces-139869.html">JSF</a> and <a href="http://nhibernate.info/">NHibernate</a>.
        I have also created small Android applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <p>
        I've made my first steps in the Windows world but have since fully converted to Linux.
        I have a good understanding of Linux systems and how to maintain them.
        I am using <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a> on my client machines and use Ubuntu, Debian or CoreOS on the server side and
        really like the transparency and simplicity of Linux and the
        <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">UNIX philosophy</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Engineering</h3>
        <p>
        I know how to solve big data problems by distributing it on multiple hosts.
        I have used message queues like <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>
        and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/de/sqs/">AWS SQS</a> to distribute jobs across multiple workers
        (like <a href="github.com/lukasmartinelli/repostruct">cloning entire GitHub</a>).
        I have also written open source message queue utilities like <a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/pipecat">pipecat</a>
        and <a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/redis-pipe">redis-pipe</a> to make messaging
        more approachable.
        </p>

        <p>
        I've used <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> and HDFS to cope with TBs of network security logs.
        </p>
        <p>I know how to scale and tune PostgreSQL to cope with large data sets, handling a billion rows and dealing with a data throughput of 30+ TB.
        </p>

        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>
        I've picked up a very good knowledge of SQL and database design along the way.
        I have mainly worked with <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server">MSSQL</a>,
        but have also used MySQL before. I have expertise in writing advanced queries, stored procedures and using databases through an ORM. I can also write advanced spatial queries with <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> (extensive use in our open source Mapbox alternative <a href="https://github.com/osm2vectortiles/osm2vectortiles">osm2vectortiles</a>). I've written an <a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/pgfutter">import tool</a> for importing JSON and CSV files into PostgreSQL.
        I'm familiar with the concepts of NoSQL and used <a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> and the Azure Key/Value store.
        </p>

        <h3>Go</h3>
        <p>
        I use <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> for CLI applications that need to be crosscompiled
        for different platforms. In my opinion it is the ideal systems programming language.
        I have built multiple popular tools with it (<a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/pipecat">pipecat</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/nigit">nigit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/pgfutter">pgfutter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/redis-pipe">redis-pipe</a>).
        </p>

        <h3>Haskell</h3>
        <p>
        I am currently learning <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and have written a <a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint">Dockerfile linter</a> with Parsec.
        I love the concepts of separating the pure and dirty code and am
        astonished by the stable software Haskell produces.
        </p>

        <h3>PHP</h3>
        <p>
        I have used PHP for small projects due to its ease of hosting and popularity. I have used <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>
        and <a href="http://grabaperch.com/">Perch</a> for client solutions.
