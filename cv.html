        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm Lukas Martinelli, a web developer from Switzerland and studying Computer Science (BSc) at the
          <a href="https://www.hsr.ch">Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am passionate about programming, the web and open source.
        I love trying out new technologies and programming languages and
        think one should always use the right tool for the job.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have always invested time and effort in my skills for building software
        and this approach has helped me to pick up new skills quickly
        and solve new challenges. While developing I like to keep things
        as simple as possible with immediate feedback (through agile planning
        and automated testing).
        </p>

        -->
        <h3>Javascript</h3>
        <p>
        I have a deep knowledge of Javascript and its quirks. I've used it in many client projects to provide
        additional functionality and to create Single Page Applications.
        I am familiar with the current Javascript frameworks and ecosystem (<a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>,
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a>).
        </p>

        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
        Even though I am more engineer than designer, I am able to create good looking websites with proper HTML and CSS.
        I put a lot of emphasis on <a href="https://smacss.com/">proper separation of concerns</a> and HTML5 semantics.
        I have a excellent knowledge of CSS and use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> together with <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> to create responsive websites in a mobile-first approach.
        </p>

        <h3>.NET Platform</h3>
        <p>
        I have a very good understanding of C# and the .NET platform, as I have used C# and the .NET platform
        intensively in the four years of my apprenticeship. I've built ASP.NET MVC web applications (mainly custom eShops)
        in a team and have good expertise with LINQ, Entity Framework, WCF Web Services and IIS.
        </p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>
        I am using Python with great joy to get stuff done quickly and glue things together, it
        is an indispensable tool in my belt.
        I have a good understanding of the language and know the community and tools around it.
        I have successfully used <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> to create web applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>
        I don't know Java as well as I know C# but have worked with it a lot
        in the courses of my Bachelor's Degree.
        </p>

        <h3>PHP</h3>
        <p>
        I use PHP for small projects due to its ease of hosting and popularity. I am using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>
        and <a href="http://grabaperch.com/">Perch</a> for client solutions.
        </p>

        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <p>
        I've made my first steps in the Windows world but have since fully converted to Linux.
        I have a good understanding of Linux systems and how to maintain them.
        I am using <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a> on my client machines and use Ubuntu on the server side.
        I really like the transparency and simplicity of Linux and the
        <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">UNIX philosophy</a>. 
        </p>

        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>
        I've picked up a good knowledge of SQL and database design along the way and have mainly worked with MSSQL,
        but also used MySQL and Postgres before.
        I have expertise in writing imports, stored procedures, reports and advanced queries, but mainly use it through an ORM nowadays.
        I'm familiar with the concepts of NoSQL and used <a href="http://ravendb.net/">RavenDB</a> and the Azure Key/Value store.
        I've also successfully used Hadoop and HDFS to cope with bigger amounts of data (parsing TBs of network security logs).
        </p>

        <h3>Cloud and Infrastructure</h3>
        I am able to take full usage of the cloud and have worked with both <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> and
        <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a>
        to create scalable solutions using messaging (<a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>).
        I apply the <a href="http://12factor.net/">twelve-factor app</a> methodology in my projects and use
        tools like <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> and
        <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> to manage my infrastructure.
        I am also interested in IAAS solutions like <a href="http://cloudstack.apache.org/">CloudStack</a>
        and <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>.

                Due to the high personal responsibility given, I was able to

        <h2>Opensource</h2>
        <p>
        Last year I started contributing to Open Source projects and I love the
        collaboration and community around it.
        </p>

        <h3>studentenportal</h3>
        <a class="gallery" href="http://studentenportal.ch"><img style="float:left;" src="/media/opensource/studentenportal.png"/></a>
        <p>
        The <a href="https://studentenportal.ch/">studentenportal</a> is a place for
        students of <a href="http://www.hsr.ch/">HSR</a> to share their documents and old exams.
        The web application is built with Django and we have about a thousand active users.
        I've taken over this project from <a href="https://dbrgn.ch/">Danilo Bargen</a> in the last year
        and am actively developing new features.
        </p>

        <h3>Cuckoo Drive</h3>
        <a class="gallery" href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/cuckoodrive"><img style="float:left;" src="/media/opensource/cuckoodrive.png"/></a>
        <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/cuckoodrive">Cuckoo Drive</a> is an
        <a href="http://lukasmartinelli.ch/idea/2014/03/11/using-the-cloud-storages-as-one-big-encrypted-disk.html">idea for an aggregated file system of public cloud storages</a> that I am developing in Python with the help of
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyfilesystem/">pyfilesystem</a>.
        I wrote several blog posts about it and I am interested in cloud storage and
        methods to make them more secure and avoid vendor lock-in.

        <h2>Freelance Work</h2>
        <p>
        I've done some freelance work for friends and profit over the last couple years.
