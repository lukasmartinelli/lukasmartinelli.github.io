        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I am a software developer and currently studying Computer Science (BSc) at the Hochschule f√ºr Technik Rapperswil.
        My interests focus on the web and open source. I love trying out different technologies and languages and
        think one should always use the right tool for the job.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
        <h3>Javascript</h3>
        <p>
            I have a deep knowledge of Javascript and it's quirks. I've used it in many client projects to provide
            additional functionality and have created Single Page Applications using current Javascript
            frameworks (<a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a> with <a href"http://durandaljs.com/">Durandal</a>,
            <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>).
            I know the Javascript ecosystem and my way around <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a>.
            I have created simple applications in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> but never had a chance to use in practice.
        </p>

        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
        Even though I have limited creative skill, I am able to create good looking websites with proper HTML.
        I put alot of emphasis on <a href="https://smacss.com/">proper separation of concerns</a> and HTML5 semantics.
        I have a very good knowledge of CSS and use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> together with <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> to create responsive and mobile-first websites.
        </p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>
        I am using Python with great joy to get stuff done quickly. I have a good understanding of the language and know
        the community and tools around it. Python is a must-have tool for me to stitch services together.
        I also have worked with Django to create a web application.
        </p>

        <h3>.NET Platform</h3>
        <p>
        I have a very good understanding of C# and the .NET platform.
        I've used C# during my apprenticeship to build ASP.NET MVC web applications (custom eShops, CMS Systems and Extranets).
        I have experience with LINQ, Entity Framework, WCF Web Services and XML/XSLT.
        </p>

        <h3>Print</h3>
        <p>
        I have worked on a custom solution to create automated product catalogs with C# and a Adobe Indesign plugin.
        </p>

        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>
        I don't know Java as good as I know C# but have worked with it on a few projects and have worked with it
        in the courses of my Bachelor's Degree.
        </p>

        <h3>PHP</h3>
        <p>
        I use PHP for small projects due to its ease of hosting and popularity. I am currently using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>
        and <a href="http://grabaperch.com/">Perch</a> for client solutions.
        </p>

        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>
        I've picked up a good knowledge of SQL and database design along the way and have mainly worked with MSSQL, but also used MySQL and PostgresSQL before.
        I am able to write imports and stored procedures and use full text search but mainly use it through an ORM nowaydays.

        I've also successfully used RavenDB as a NoSQL database.
        And have used Hadoop and HDFS to cope with bigger amounts of data.
        </p>

        <h3>Infrastructure and Cloud</h3>
        <p>
        I love stitching things together and quickly build up solutions. I have a good toolbelt of Unix and other tools
        I can use.
        I know alot about managing infrastructure using tools like Puppet or Ansible and currently use the new hotness Docker to manage
        my infrastructure. As a true geek I also manage my own mail server, vpn, git repo etc.
        I have worked with both AWS and Azure and am very interested in CloudStack and OpenStack.
        </p>

        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <p>
        I've made my first steps in the windows world but have since fully converted to a linux lover. I am using ArchLinux on all my
        client machines and mainly use Ubuntu on the server side. I am currently looking into CoreOS as my new server platform.
        I really like the transparency and simplicity of Linux and it's UNIX way of doing things.
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
        I have strong interests in security and were able to work on several security related projects.
        </p>
