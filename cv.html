        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm Lukas Martinelli, a freelance web developer from Switzerland and currently studying Computer Science (BSc) at the Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil.
        I am very passionate about programming, the web and open source. I love trying out new technologies and programming languages and
        think one should always use the right tool for the job.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
        <h3>Javascript</h3>
        <p>
            I have a deep knowledge of Javascript and it's quirks. I've used it in many client projects to provide
            additional functionality and to create Single Page Applications.
            I am familiar with the current Javascript frameworks and ecosystem (NodeJS, npm and grunt).
        </p>

        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>
        Even though I am more engineer than designer, I am able to create good looking websites with proper HTML and CSS.
        I put alot of emphasis on <a href="https://smacss.com/">proper separation of concerns</a> and HTML5 semantics.
        I have a very good knowledge of CSS and use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> together with <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> to create responsive and mobile-first websites.
        </p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>
        I am using Python with great joy to get stuff done quickly and glue things together, it
        is an indispensable tool in my belt.
        I have a good understanding of the language and know the community and tools around it.
        I have successfully used Django to create web applications.
        </p>

        <h3>.NET Platform</h3>
        <p>
        I have a very good understanding of C# and the .NET platform, as I have used C# and the .NET platform
        intensively in the years of my apprenticeship. I've built ASP.NET MVC web applications (custom eShops, CMS Systems and Extranets)
        in a SCRUM based team. I have good expertise with LINQ, Entity Framework, WCF Web Services and XML/XSLT.
        </p>

        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>
        I don't know Java as good as I know C# but have worked with it alot
        in the courses of my Bachelor's Degree.
        </p>

        <h3>PHP</h3>
        <p>
        I use PHP for small projects due to its ease of hosting and popularity. I am currently using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>
        and <a href="http://grabaperch.com/">Perch</a> for client solutions.
        </p>

        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>
        I've picked up a good knowledge of SQL and database design along the way and have mainly worked with MSSQL, but also used MySQL and Postgres before.
        I have expertise in writing imports, stored procedures and advanced queries but mainly use it through an ORM nowaydays.
        I'm familiar with the concepts of NoSQL and used RavenDB and the Azure Key/Value store.
        I've also successfully used Hadoop and HDFS to cope with bigger amounts of data (parsing TBs of network security logs).
        </p>

        <h3>Cloud and Infrastructure</h3>
        I am able to take full usage of the cloud and have worked with both AWS and Azure to create scalable solutions using Messaging.
        I know alot about managing infrastructure using tools like Puppet and Ansible and currently use Docker to manage my servers.
        I am also very interested in IAAS solutions like CloudStack and OpenStack.

        <h3>Linux</h3>
        <p>
        I've made my first steps in the Windows world but have since fully converted to Linux. I am using ArchLinux on my
        client machines and use Ubuntu on the server side. I am currently looking into CoreOS as my new server platform.
        I really like the transparency and simplicity of Linux and it's UNIX way of doing things.
        </p>

                I was able to experience four wonderful and very educational years
                as software engineer trainee working at
                <a href="http://www.online.ch">Online Consulting</a>.
                Due to the high personal responsibility given, I was able to
                work on many projects and make substantial progress as a developer.

                and created a concept how to create offline web applications
                for service technicians.

        <h2>Opensource</h2>
        <p>
        Last year I started contributing to Open Source projects and I love the
        collaboration and community around it.

        students of HSR to share their documents and past exams.
        The web application is built with Django and we have about a thousand
        active users.
        I've taken over this project from <a href="https://dbrgn.ch/">Danilo Bargen</a> in the last year
        and am actively developing new features.
