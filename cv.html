        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I am a software developer and currently studying Computer Science (BSc) at the Hochschule f√ºr Technik Rapperswil.
        My interests focus on the web and open source. I love trying out different technologies and languages and
        think one should always use the right tool for the job.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>

            <h4>Javascript</h4>
            I have a deep knowledge of Javascript and it's quirks. I've used it in many client projects to provide
            additional functionality and have created Single Page Applications using current Javascript
            frameworks (Knockout with [Durandal](http://durandaljs.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)).
            I know the Javascript ecosystem and my way around npm and grunt. I have created simple applications in NodeJS but never had a chance
            to use in practice.

            <h4>HTML and CSS</h4>
            Even though I have limited creative skill, I am able to produce semantic and correct HTML. I put emphasis on proper separation of
            concerns and use SASS together with Compass to create responsive and mobile-first websites.

            <h4>.NET Platform</h4>
            I have a very good understanding of C# and the .NET platform. I've used C# to build ASP.NET MVC web applications (custom eShops, CMS Systems or
            Extranets).

            <h4>ePrint</h4>
            I have worked on a custom solution to create automated product catalogs with C# and Adobe Indesign.

            <h4>Python</h4>
            I am using Python to get stuff done quickly. I am using it since one year in practice

            <h4>Java</h4>
            I've worked with Java and know my way around. I know much mure about C# though.

            <h4>PHP</h4>
            I use PHP for small projects due to its popularity. I don't like it though. 

            <h4>Database</h4>
            I've picked up a good knowledge of SQL and have worked with MSSQL, MySQL and PostgresSQL. Though I mainly use it
            through ORMS nowadays.

            I've also worked with NoSQL databases like RavenDB and MongoDB. 
            And have used Hadoop and HDFS to cope with bigger amounts of data.

            <h4>Infrastructure</h4>
            I love stitching things together and quickly build up solutions. I have a good toolbelt of Unix and other tools
            I can use.

            <h4>Linux</h4>
            Even though my beginnings in software were all focused on the Windows world I've fully converted to using Linux
            not only for server projects but also as my personal machine.

            <h4>Cloud</h4>
            I have worked with both AWS and Azure and am very interested in CloudStack and OpenStack.

            <h4>Security</h4>
            I have strong interests in security and were able to work on several security related projects.
