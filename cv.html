    <div class="content">
        <p>
        I'm <a href="/cv.html">Lukas Martinelli</a>, a software engineer working on maps and the big data infrastructure to make them happen.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am very passionate about maps, the web and especially <a href="/projects.html">open source</a>.
        I love trying out new technologies and programming languages and
        have acquired a large and broad skill set across the entire software stack.
        </p>

        <h2>Expertise</h2>
        <p>I have a very good general purpose skill set consisting out of Linux, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node, Linux, Go and Haskell as well as experience in data engineering, PostgreSQL and PostGIS, OpenStreetMap and scaling applications in the cloud.</p>
        <p>My expertise lies applying these skills to GIS to create maps and enable geospatial business intelligence - all of this in distributed systems so it can scale with ever growing GIS data.
        </p>
        <p>My projects and past work experience are the best proof of what I work on and am capable of!
           I still have an older more detailed list with my <a href="/skills.html">technical skills</a>

                I was able to experience four wonderful and educational years
                as software engineer trainee working at
                <a href="http://www.online.ch">Online Consulting</a>.
                Due to the high personal responsibility given, I was able to
                work on many projects and make substantial progress as a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                As web developer, I helped to create custom web applications
                for customers like <a href="shop.kubo.ch/">Kubo</a> or
                <a href="http://www.glomar.ch/">Glomar</a> and made cost estimations
                and evaluations for projects.

                <p>
                As part of a SCRUM team I helped develop parts of the PIM platform
                <a href="http://www.online.ch/oc/pim-ecommerce.aspx">Smartsite EPM</a>
                and created a concept how to create offline web applications
                for service technicians.
                </p>
                <p>
                I was also part of the core team to develop and
                work with a custom solution for generating automated product catalogs
                with Adobe Indesign.
                I still work on a contract basis with Online Consulting to maintain
